# PROJET-DATAVIZ

This project aimed to choose a dataset (e.g., open data) to create a Tableau workbook with three worksheets. The data should be real, organized into one or more tables, regardless of their technical format.

The worksheets must meet the following conditions:

-  The data must be presented by folder (not by table) and fully qualified (data types, dimension/measure, continuous/discrete, folders, geographic role, hierarchies, groups, default numeric format, etc.)

-  The graphical representations must be of three different types of charts (lines, histograms, maps, etc.) and, of course, show different data combinations.

-  These worksheets must have a clear title and all necessary information for understanding (legend, axis title, etc.)

-  The workbook must use at least one calculated field or table calculation.

-  The graphical representations must show a clear interpretation of the data.
